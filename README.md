# week9-lamp

This project aims to automate the installation of a LAMP stack server and WordPress on an EC2 instance using Terraform. It begins with setting up the necessary prerequisites, including installing Terraform and AWS CLI. The project then guides you through creating a project directory and various Terraform configuration files (main.tf, generate_key.tf, var.tf, output.tf, and install_lamp.sh). These files define the infrastructure, including the VPC, subnets, security groups, and the EC2 instance, along with user data for installing the LAMP stack and WordPress. After initializing and applying the Terraform configuration, an EC2 instance is launched, and WordPress is configured through a web interface. The final step involves destroying the created infrastructure using Terraform commands. The project demonstrates how to efficiently deploy and manage cloud resources for web hosting.
